/**
 * Browser-side Supabase client, created lazily and only if the project is
 * configured.
 *
 * Accounts are an *optional* feature at the deployment level, not just the
 * user level: if `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
 * are absent, `getSupabaseClient()` returns `null`, every auth/sync code path
 * short-circuits, and the app behaves exactly like the localStorage-only V1 —
 * no sign-in UI, no network calls, no errors. That keeps the existing
 * zero-config Vercel deploy working untouched.
 *
 * Both values are safe to ship to the browser: the anon key is a public,
 * publishable key whose privileges are defined entirely by the row-level
 * security policies in `supabase/migrations/`. It is not a secret, and the
 * service-role key is never used anywhere in this app.

 * and `/rest/v1` paths, so the mistake produces requests to
 * `/rest/v1/auth/v1/token` — a 404 that reads like a bad API key and sends
 * people hunting in entirely the wrong place.
 *
 * Only a recognized API suffix is stripped, not any path, so a self-hosted
 * instance served under a path prefix still works.
