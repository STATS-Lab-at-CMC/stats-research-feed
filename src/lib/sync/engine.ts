/**
 * Local-first sync engine.
 *
 * The model, stated plainly:
 *
 *   * localStorage is always what the UI renders from. Signed out, that is the
 *     whole story and nothing here runs.
 *   * On sign-in, one of two things happens. If the account has never synced
 *     (no `user_settings` row), local state is *seeded upward* into the cloud,
 *     so a researcher who spent months curating a watchlist anonymously keeps
 *     it when they make an account. Otherwise the cloud is authoritative and
 *     overwrites local state.
 *   * While signed in, each mutation is pushed as a delta, and the cloud is
 *     re-pulled on load and when the tab regains focus.
 *
 * Cloud-wins-on-load is a deliberate choice over merge-on-load. A union would
 * resurrect journals the user had deliberately unfollowed and articles they
 * had deliberately marked unseen, because "absent" and "deleted" are
 * indistinguishable in a union. The cost is that a mutation made while
 * genuinely offline is lost if the tab reloads before reconnecting; that is
 * recorded in the README's limitations rather than papered over.
