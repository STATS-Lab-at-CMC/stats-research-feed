              <TextLink href={OPENALEX_URL}>OpenAlex</TextLink>, a free and open catalog of the
              world&apos;s scholarly literature maintained by the non-profit OurResearch. It indexes
              works, authors, and journals across essentially all of academic publishing, and is the
              successor to Microsoft Academic Graph.
            </p>
            <p>
              This app talks to the public OpenAlex REST API at{" "}
              <code className="rounded bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 text-xs">api.openalex.org</code> (
              <TextLink href={OPENALEX_DOCS_URL}>documentation</TextLink>). Nothing is scraped from
              publisher sites, and no other data source is involved.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those requests go through this site rather than straight from your browser, because
              OpenAlex now requires an API key to retrieve more than the first page of results and
              that key has to stay on the server. A side effect is that OpenAlex sees this
              site&apos;s address rather than yours.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="Does it cost anything?">
            <p>
              <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Not for you.</span> OpenAlex data is
              free and open, and this app queries it without an API key or any payment. Every
              request it makes to OpenAlex is read-only and anonymous, signed in or not.
            </p>
            <p>
              OpenAlex does meter API usage as a small daily budget. Keyless access, which is what
              this app uses, is about $0.10 of usage per day — roughly 1,000 list queries. A free
              API key raises that tenfold, and paid plans raise it further. The ceiling on request
              rate is 100 per second.
            </p>
            <p>
              Normal use sits far below that budget. Loading a 26-journal watchlist from cold costs
              only a handful of requests, because journal lookups are cached for 24 hours, results
              for 20 minutes, and many journals are combined into one call rather than queried
              separately. Revisiting within 20 minutes costs nothing at all.

              <li>
                Matches each journal on your watchlist to its OpenAlex source record by ISSN, the
                stable identifier OpenAlex recommends over title matching.

                <span className="font-medium text-foreground">90 days</span>, batching up to 40
                journals per request and sorting newest first.
              </li>
              <li>
                Keeps only items OpenAlex classifies as research articles or reviews, and drops
                anything flagged as retracted. Errata, corrections, editorials, and letters are
                filtered out before they reach you.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reconstructs each abstract from OpenAlex&apos;s inverted index, removes duplicate
                records, and groups the result by recency.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Open Access badges come from OpenAlex&apos;s own open-access status for each work. If
              OpenAlex cannot be reached, the app falls back to a small built-in sample so the
              interface still works, and tells you it is doing so.
