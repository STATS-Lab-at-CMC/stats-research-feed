# Turning on optional accounts

STATS Research Feed works with no backend at all. Everything a reader does —
their watchlist, what they have marked seen, what they have saved — lives in
their browser, and that stays true whether or not you follow this guide.

Setting up Supabase adds **one optional thing**: a reader can sign in with
their email and have those three things follow them to another computer. No
part of the app requires it, and if the environment variables below are
absent, no sign-in UI is rendered and no network calls are made.

Budget about 15 minutes. You need a free Supabase account.

---

## 1. Create the project

1. Go to [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) and create a
   new project.
2. Give it a name (`stats-research-feed` is fine), set a database password,
   and pick the region closest to your users.
3. Wait for provisioning to finish — a couple of minutes.

## 2. Create the tables

In the dashboard, open **SQL Editor → New query**. Run each migration in
[`supabase/migrations/`](supabase/migrations/) in order, pasting the whole file
and pressing **Run**:

1. [`0001_user_state.sql`](supabase/migrations/0001_user_state.sql) — watchlist, seen articles, saved articles
2. [`0002_zotero_exports.sql`](supabase/migrations/0002_zotero_exports.sql) — record of what has been exported to Zotero
3. [`0003_custom_journals.sql`](supabase/migrations/0003_custom_journals.sql) — journals added beyond the built-in catalog

Both are idempotent, so re-running either is harmless.

Together they create five tables and — importantly — the row-level security
policies that make each row readable and writable only by the user it belongs
to.

| Table | Holds |
|---|---|
| `user_settings` | One row per user: their followed journal ids. The row's existence also marks the account as initialized. |
| `seen_articles` | One row per article marked seen. |
| `saved_articles` | One row per bookmark, with a full snapshot of the article. |
| `zotero_exports` | One row per article already sent to Zotero, so a second export from any device skips it. **Never stores Zotero credentials** — the API key stays in the browser that entered it. |
| `custom_journals` | Journals the user added beyond the built-in catalog. Synced because the watchlist syncs ids, and an id without its definition is useless on another device. |

Verify it worked: **Table Editor** should list all five, each showing an
"RLS enabled" badge. If any table says RLS is *disabled*, stop and re-run the
script — without those policies every user could read every other user's rows.

## 3. Point the app at the project

In the dashboard, open **Project Settings → API** and copy:

- the **Project URL**, and
- the **anon / public** key (also labelled *publishable*).

Create `.env.local` in the repository root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then edit it to hold your two real values:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOi...
```

Restart `npm run dev`. A **Sign in** button should now appear in the header.

> **Never put the `service_role` key here.** It bypasses row-level security
> entirely, and anything in a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variable is compiled into the
> JavaScript every visitor downloads. The anon key is designed to be public;
> the service-role key is not, and this app never uses it.

## 4. Allow the redirect URLs

Supabase will only send people back to URLs you have allowlisted. Under
**Authentication → URL Configuration**:

- **Site URL**: `http://localhost:3000` while developing, your real domain in
  production.
- **Redirect URLs**: add every origin the app runs on, with the callback path:
  - `http://localhost:3000/auth/confirm`
  - `https://your-app.vercel.app/auth/confirm`
  - `https://your-app-*.vercel.app/auth/confirm` *(only if you want Vercel
    preview deployments to be able to sign in — wildcards are supported)*

Getting this wrong is the single most common cause of a link that opens to
"Sign-in failed". The app always asks Supabase to redirect to
`<current origin>/auth/confirm`, so whatever origin you browse from must be
listed.

## 5. Sort out email delivery before you share it

This is the step people skip and regret.

Supabase's built-in email service is **rate-limited to 2 messages per hour**
and is explicitly described by Supabase as best-effort and *not* for
production — it exists for exploring Auth and testing templates. That is
enough to test the flow yourself. It is nowhere near enough for a lab, a
seminar, or anyone you share the link with.

For real use, connect a custom SMTP provider under **Authentication → Emails
→ SMTP Settings**. [Resend](https://resend.com) has a free tier that is ample
here. Once custom SMTP is configured Supabase applies a default limit of 30
messages per hour, which you can raise under **Authentication → Rate Limits**.

While you are there, know that **institutional mail is the other hazard**.
University filters sometimes quarantine automated sign-in mail, and some
security scanners *follow* links in incoming mail before the human does —
which consumes a one-time sign-in link and produces a confusing failure. The
app's "check your email" screen warns about exactly this. A properly
configured sending domain (SPF/DKIM via your SMTP provider) makes it much
rarer.

## 6. Deploy

Add the same two variables in **Vercel → your project → Settings →
Environment Variables**, for every environment you want accounts on, then
redeploy. Add the deployed origin's `/auth/confirm` to the Supabase redirect
allowlist from step 4.

If you deploy *without* the variables, the deployment simply has no accounts —
which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do for a public demo.

---

## Replace the email templates (not optional for institutional email)

Supabase's default templates link to `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`, which points at
its `/auth/v1/verify` endpoint. That endpoint redeems the one-time token on
**any** GET request — including one made by a mail security scanner.

This is not hypothetical. On this project's first real sign-in, a `cmc.edu`
address held the message for four minutes before delivery, and the link was
already spent by the time a human clicked it: "Email link is invalid or has
expired", on a link nobody had used. University mail systems scan inbound
links as a matter of course, so expect this wherever your readers are.

Paste the two templates in
[`supabase/email-templates/`](supabase/email-templates/) into
**Authentication → Emails → Templates**. They link to the app's own
`/auth/confirm` page carrying `{{ .TokenHash }}`, which redeems the token by
calling `verifyOtp` in the browser — so fetching the URL does nothing and
scanners, which do not run JavaScript, leave it intact.

**Update both tabs.** Confirm signup is what a first-time reader gets;
Magic Link is only used once an account exists. Changing just one and testing
with a fresh address will look like nothing happened.

They also carry the lab's name and branding, explain what the feed is, and
give a contact address — which matters, because the stock template reads like
phishing to anyone who was not expecting it.

**Each email contains a 6-digit code as well as a link**, and the code is shown
first on purpose. A link can be spent before the reader clicks it; a code typed
by hand cannot be consumed by anything. For institutional addresses the code is
the path that reliably works, so the sign-in dialog offers the code field as
soon as the email is requested.

## A note on Reply-To

Supabase has no Reply-To setting. Its SMTP configuration covers sender
address, sender name, and credentials, and nothing else — so a reply goes to
whatever the sender address is.

Two ways to handle that:

- **Put a contact address in the template body.** Both templates here link to
  `info@statslabatcmc.com`. Costs nothing, and works today.
- **Send from an address that is a real mailbox.** Set the sender to the
  address you want replies at. This needs that address's domain verified in
  Resend — the apex `statslabatcmc.com` is a different domain from the
  already-verified `mail.statslabatcmc.com`, so it needs adding separately.

## Checking it actually works

1. Click **Sign in**, enter your email, submit.
2. The dialog should switch to "Check your email".
3. Open the link. You should land on `/auth/confirm`, see "Signing you in…",
   and be returned to the feed with your email in the header.
4. Open **Table Editor → user_settings**. There should be exactly one row,
   with your followed journal ids in it.
5. Mark an article seen, then check `seen_articles` for a new row.
6. Open the app in a different browser, sign in as the same user, and confirm
   the watchlist and seen article carry over.

Step 6 is the one worth doing — it is the only one that proves sync, rather
than proving that writes happen.

## When something goes wrong

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| No **Sign in** button at all | Environment variables missing or the dev server was not restarted after adding them. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined at build time. |
| "Could not reach the sign-in service" | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` is wrong, or the project is paused. Free projects pause after a week of inactivity — resume it in the dashboard. |
| Link opens to "Sign-in failed" | The origin you are browsing from is not in the redirect allowlist (step 4), or the link was already used or expired. |
| No email arrives | The 2-per-hour built-in limit, or a spam filter. See step 5. |
| Signed in, but nothing syncs | The migration did not run, or RLS policies are missing. Check **Table Editor** for the three tables and the "RLS enabled" badge. The account dialog shows the server's actual error message. |
| "new row violates row-level security policy" | The tables exist but the policies from step 2 do not. Re-run the migration. |

## What this does and does not protect

The anon key in the browser bundle grants nothing on its own. Every table
denies access by default and allows a row only when `auth.uid()` matches that
row's `user_id`, checked by Postgres on both read and write. A reader cannot
see, modify, or delete another reader's data, and an unauthenticated visitor
cannot touch any of it.

What it does *not* do: there is no encryption at rest beyond what Supabase
provides, no audit log, and no deletion UI. A user who wants their data gone
has to ask you to delete their row — `delete from auth.users where email =
'...'` cascades to all three tables. If you plan to use this with human
subjects or anything IRB-relevant, that gap is worth closing first.
